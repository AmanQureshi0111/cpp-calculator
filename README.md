# C++ WebAssembly Calculator

A modern web-based calculator powered by **C++** compiled to **WebAssembly (WASM)** using [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).  
This project allows evaluating mathematical expressions entered by the user in a browser interface.

## 🛠 Features

- Evaluate expressions containing digits, `+`, `-`, `(`, `)`, and spaces.
- Real-time calculation using a **C++ backend** compiled to WebAssembly.
- Clean and responsive UI.
- Rules displayed for valid expression input.

## 📜 Rules for Writing Expressions

1. Expression can contain digits, `+`, `-`, `(`, `)`, and spaces.  
2. Expression must be valid.  
3. `+` cannot be used as a unary operator (e.g., `+1` and `+(2+3)` are invalid).  
4. `-` can be used as a unary operator (e.g., `-1` and `-(2+3)` are valid).  
5. No two consecutive operators are allowed.

## ⚙ Installation & Deployment

### Prerequisites

- [Emscripten SDK](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) installed
- Python (for local server testing)

### Steps to Build

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmanQureshi0111/cpp-calculator
   cd cpp-calculator
2. Compile C++ to WebAssembly:
   ```
   emcc calculator.cpp -s WASM=1 -s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_evalExpression']" -s "EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=['cwrap']" -o calculator.js
## Run Locally
### Run a local server and open in your browser:
```
python -m http.server 8080
```
### Then open:
```
http://localhost:8080
```
